**Want to start your own journal club?**

Do it! It's a low commitment, fun and flexible way to start spreading Open Science ideas in your department. Plus you get **free merchandise** sponsored by the UK Reproducible Research Network. 

We have an [OSF page <sup><i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i></sup>](https://osf.io/3qrj6/wiki/home/) where you can download all the necessary materials that you can freely share and adapt. There you will find:
- A welcome letter telling you more about ReproducibiliTea
- The ReproducibiliTea Logo
- Various ReproducibiliTea poster templates
- A sample checklist for organising your own Journal Club
- Paper suggestions for what to cover 
- And much much more ... 

We also maintain a [central Zotero library <sup><i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i></sup>](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2354006/reproducibilitea/items/) with collections for each individual journal club, as well as a folder of suggestions for [introductory papers <sup><i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i></sup>](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2354006/reproducibilitea/items/collectionKey/5EMUTRWM) for the first few journal clubs.

If you are planning to start your own ReproducibiliTea journal club please get in touch with Amy Orben (amy.orben@cantab.net). If you are from a UK university you will then be sent a starter pack including a spectacular teapot (!). If you are from another university you will be sent some just as amazing stickers! Amy will also add you to an amazing Slack channel that will help you keep in touch with other journal clubs around the world. 

We now have journal clubs set up in many universities. Please use the search tool below to find out if there's one in your area:
