ReproducibiliTea journal clubs help young researchers build a community of ECRs interested in open and reproducible research. It can be isolating to be one of the few within a research group, or department, that are actively engaged in improving research practices. In the ReproducibiliTea Journal Club, papers are selected that are broadly relevant to the replication crisis and the emerging credibility revolution to be discussed on a weekly basis during term time. The ReproducibiliTea Journal Club has proven to be a success in Oxford and has received International recognition. There are now more than 27 other ReproducibiliTea Journal Clubs registered to date, with more joining at an increasingly faster rate.
